I Got this error-
! [rejected]        master -> dev (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://myusername@bitbucket.org/repo_user/repo_name.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
Solution:
	$git push -f origin main/master
